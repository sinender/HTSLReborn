## Overview

HTSL Reborn is a fabric mod that makes programming in Hypixel's Housing gamemode easier. With the help of [SystemsAPI](https://github.com/redstone-llc/SystemsAPI), HTSL Reborn will port HTSL's syntax to latest versions, eventually allowing for a seamless switch, and a large possibility for more features to make things work nicer with Housing.
