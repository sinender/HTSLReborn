## Overview

HTSL Reborn is a fabric mod that makes programming in Hypixel's Housing gamemode easier. With the help of [SystemsAPI](https://github.com/redstone-llc/SystemsAPI), HTSL Reborn will port HTSL's syntax to latest versions, eventually allowing for a seamless switch, and a large possibility for more features to make things work nicer with Housing.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress, and is not ready for use! Expect constant changes at this stage.

## Features

- [x] Language parity with HTSL (your HTSL scripts will work flawlessly!)
- [x] Importing to Housing
- [ ] Exporting to code
- [ ] Expressions (Javascript math, etc.)
- [ ] Compiler shortcuts (define statements)
- [ ] Loops
